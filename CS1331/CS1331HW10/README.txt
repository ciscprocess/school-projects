Okay, I'll admit it.
I screwed up. I tried to do way too much, and now my grade is going to be in the toilet.
My only hope here is that my isometric engine, custom graphics, pseudo-level editor, and unincorporated title music 
will help save me. 

It's a dang shame too, as I WAS proud of how it was shaping up.
